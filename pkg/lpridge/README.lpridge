This is the README file for loading the Splus function lpridge (local 
polynomial regression fitting with ridging).
Version 11. 04. 95

You should now have the following files:

	lpridge.f		fortran-code
	lpridge.s		interface function that calls lpridge.f
	lpridge.d		Splus help file for lpridge
	lpridge.input		source file to create the functions 

To load the functions start Splus in this directory and run:

	> source("lpridge.input")

In every new Splus session you have to load the fortran routine again:

	> dyn.load("lpridge.o")

We are interested in any information on the numerical and statistical
behavior of our routine. Any suggestion, how to make the function more 
user-friendly, or how to implement it into other software, are welcome.
Questions and comments should be directed to
