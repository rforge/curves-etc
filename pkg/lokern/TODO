  o Want class()ed results which have  print.*,
    summary.* (maybe lines.*) and plot.* methods.
    --> residuals() !!

    For residuals, want to use  sfsmisc::seqXtend() {-> sfsmisc:roundfixS() }
    --> dependency on  sfsmisc
    [[Alternative:  Write small paper on  seqXtend() & roundfixS()
                    and move these to  utils ]]

    -- see R/lokerns.R.~future~
       	   --------------------

   NOTE: I had the following in ./ChangeLog  (note the date !!)

   2003-11-04  Martin Maechler  <maechler@stat.math.ethz.ch>

	* DESCRIPTION (Version): 1.1-0 : new: using class();...

	* src/lokerns.f (lokerns): switched arg. 3 <-> 4; s/smo/inputb/

	* R/lokerns.R (fitted.KernS): use class(); x.out should include x
	        --> changes to do smart x.out;  residuals() and fitted()

   TODO: The same for R/glkerns.R
   ------------------------------


  o The Fortran-algorithm  in parts heavily relies on   t_i < t_{i+1}
    When we have *duplicated* x's  [or "nearly-duplicated" ones which may
    be even more subtle ! --- there maybe numerical problems that we should
    deal with.
    The smooth.spline() - like solution requires an algorithm that works
    with *weights*  ... and that maybe much too much work, needing more
    theoretical work, first !

  o Both functions now return lists almost identical;
    this is nice and useful.

    plot(): see the extensive  lokerns() and glkerns() examples.
    {think about "deriv" !}

  o The 2 man pages look very similar;  ``clean up''
