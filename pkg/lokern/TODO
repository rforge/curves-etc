  o The 2 man pages look very similar;  ``clean up''

  o Both functions now return lists almost identical;
    this is nice and useful.

    Actually they should give class()ed results which have  print.*,
    summary.* (maybe lines.*) and plot.* methods.

    plot(): see the extensive  lokerns() and glkerns() examples.
    {think about "deriv" !}


  o  n = 3 is allowed (R & Fortran) but always (?) returns NaN  ??
    e.g.
         str(lokerns(c(1:2,4),c(2,1,7), n.out=8),vec.len=10)
