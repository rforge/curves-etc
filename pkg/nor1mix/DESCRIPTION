Description: Onedimensional Normal (i.e. Gaussian) Mixture Models Classes,
   for, e.g., density estimation or clustering algorithms research and teaching;
   providing the widely used Marron-Wand densities.  Efficient random
   number generation and graphics; now fitting to data by ML (Maximum
   Likelihood) or EM estimation.
