1)  We *should* have a reasonable default bandwidth !

2)  should return a simple S3 class with print(), residuals(), fitted(),
   etc.  Possibly use seqXtend() as now in  lokerns() in ../lokern/R/lokerns.R

3) Look at  ../lpridge.Rcheck-64b/00install.out  and eliminate remaining
   Fortran warnings

4) Don't have examples (nor tests, yet) using  'deriv > 0'
